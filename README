(Note: the project is hacky and unreliable)

1. "make" will provide libtimeskew.so
2. Use `TIMESKEW="2 1" LD_PRELOAD=./libtimeskew.so program` to start program with time 2x faster than usual
3. Create/update "timeskew" file in current directory to update time coefficient, e.g. `echo 1 3 > timeskew` - slow down 3x.

TIMESHIFT also sets constant time shift
